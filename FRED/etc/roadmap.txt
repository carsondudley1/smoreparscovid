===========================================================

FRED Core Roadmap

This section refers to plans for changes to FRED Core, consisting of the
C++ source files in FRED/src and the scripts in FRED/bin.

Continuous:
- Documentation
-- FRED/doc/Agent-Based Modeling with FRED.pdf
-- FRED/doc/parameters_and_factors.txt
-- FRED/etc/roadmap.txt (this document)

Wish List:
- Replace Travel with a Condition
-- Eliminate Age_Map class
- Add MSA as an Admin_Division
-- include Term to test for MSA residence
- Move Ages and Stages code from County to Demographics class
- Move health and activities to Person class
- Define Neighborhoods based on census_tracts
- Rewrite Vector model
- Healthcare Condition
-- For dynamically selecting healthcare facilities
- Climate layer
-- Temp and humidity variation at county or MSA level
- Sensitivity Analysis
- Parallel processing
-- fork multiple runs after reading input files
-- fork on place type transmissions
---- e.g. all Schools in parallel

==============================

March 2018:
- Continuous state variables
- API for external models

June 2018
- Abstract Place types
- Ages and Stages for all locations
- Recalibrate contact models

Aug 2018
- Eliminated Neighborhood, Classroom, Workplace, Office classes
- Creat CHECK_PARAMETERS file on request

Nov 2018
- Speed up fred_make_csv_files

Dec 2018
- Network_Type as base class for Place_Type
- Meta agents for importation and for place administrators
- Personal variable in My Condition
- Terms for time, date

Jan 2019
- Import agent for exogeneous exposure
- Add term for head of household
- Terms for day_of_week, day_of_month, hour of day
- Create bad_params.txt for each run
- Example model of agent adaptation using personal variables

Feb 2019:
- Hourly schedules for place types
- Hourly schedules for agents
- Schedule transitions at specific times, days
- State-specific activity cancellation
- Terms for testing agent location
- Updated calibration methods
- Allow transitions at specified day and time
- Allow NOT in any propositional term
- Allow AND in any propositional term

March 2019:
- Networks
-- Generate initial networks with topological characteristics
---- degree distr, betweeness, small-world, exponential
-- Network properties for homophily
---- biases for any personal var
-- Network properties for duration
-- Methods for init, selecting link, breaking link

Jun 2019
- Recalibrate contact models against target contact matrix

Dec 2019
- Complete documentation and training materials

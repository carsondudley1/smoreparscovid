# Class level logging defaults
# TRACE    Designates finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG.
# DEBUG    Designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.
# INFO     Designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level.
# WARN     Designates potentially harmful situations.
# ERR      Designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
# CRITICAL Designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
# OFF      The highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.
#
# NOTE: TRACE < DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERR < CRITICAL < OFF
